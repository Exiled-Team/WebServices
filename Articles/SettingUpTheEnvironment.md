### Specifications

Exiled supports multiple programming languages such as C#, VB.NET, and F#, all of which run on the .NET Framework. It's essential to note that Exiled requires .NET Framework 4.8, as projects running on different .NET versions may encounter compatibility issues. To simplify dependency management, Exiled provides a NuGet package, enabling users to quickly integrate it into their projects.

### Supported Languages and Frameworks

Exiled currently runs on C# 9.0, though other C# versions are compatible. The choice of programming language depends on personal preference and project requirements. However, it's essential to ensure compatibility with the .NET Framework 4.8.

### Project Setup

- Open your preferred IDE
- Create a new project with a Dynamic Link Library (.dll) project type.
- Ensure the project is set to .NET Framework 4.8 to maintain compatibility with Exiled.
